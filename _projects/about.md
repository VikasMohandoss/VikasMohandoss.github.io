I am an Engineer at Microsoft. I studied CS at NITK Surathkal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology,_Karnataka) and then attended Columbia University (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University) to learn Machine Learning to make machines learn. (Say that fast and on repeat).

### More Information

Right now, I hope to make products intelligent, responsive and fast but also not intrusive. Eventually, I hope to uncover the secrets of the human mind and enhance its capabilities. I have loved Chelsea FC for 12 years for reasons unknown (Hence, my long term goal). I really really want to win my Fantasy Premier League Mini-League every season. In this blog, you may encounter sudden inactivity and typos for which I apologize beforehand.
