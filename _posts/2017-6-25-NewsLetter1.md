June-July 2017

I feel sorry for wasting resources on Github. Hence, I'm starting a newsletter about topics that I found interesting in this time frame and random spiel that I'd like to share. It will help serve as my dashboard, that is accessible on all devices and hopefully is useful to at least 1 more person.

NewsLetter 

AI -

1. Yaov Goldberg and Yann LeCunn's popcorn consuming take on ArXiv and the publicity(false?) of neural nets - https://medium.com/@yoav.goldberg/an-adversarial-review-of-adversarial-generation-of-natural-language-409ac3378bd7, https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10154498539442143, https://medium.com/@yoav.goldberg/a-response-to-yann-lecuns-response-245125295c02
2. SELU Activation Function that helps self normalize neural nets - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf. Fun Note : One of the authors - Hochreiter published a paper on LSTM in 1997. (I really do not know my target audience, so forgive me)
3. All developers calling, Google's in-house object detection system is now open sourced. Yes! until of course free trial runs out... I miss the old days when I could build local models and feel smug about accuracy. (And, I didn’t have to pay!)
4. Neural Network inception by Christopher Google Nolan
https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/using-machine-learning-to-explore.html
5. Speaking of neural nets, there is now one to rule the world. - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05137.pdf
I wish there were more details in the paper. Deep Learning papers are always so obscure. (Are they written by neural nets?)

Systems - 

1. Chandler Carruth is a funny guy. Loved his video on Algorithms for efficiency and data structures for performance - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHNmRkzxHWs&t=3586s, compiler 
2. Another Chandler Carruth video on compiler optimization - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnGCDLhaxKU
3. A look into Google's TPU - https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/05/an-in-depth-look-at-googles-first-tensor-processing-unit-tpu
4. Mike Acton on data oriented design. Haven’t seen it yet but have heard excellent reviews - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc
5. Also currently reading a book - Parallel Computing for data science by Norman Matloff. Highly recommend it thus far. (Will touch upon this again on completion).

In a land far far away -

1. Elon Musk's plan to conquer Mars - http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/space.2017.29009.emu

Personal -

LinkedLists are so bad! Never use them if you care about performance.
They mess up cache access. Simple Stat - 3B cycles per second on one of my processors(Wow!), 50% of that time is on I/O (Damn!). Efficient Algorithms -> Better data structures -> Better caching -> Faster data access from memory -> Happy Life, unless of course you can afford clusters in which case, please ignore this. Debugging performance bottlenecks is hard. Machine Learning is hard. 

Took part in the T-mobil Big Data hackathon (March 2017) and made an application that automatically tags photos and uploads to Instagram based on object detection and location features. I love solving laziness. Now, only if I can get myself to use social media and upload these damn pictures so they can get tagged. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEaGuX18sz4&t=27s

Took part in AI++ Weekend (April 2017) and made an anomaly detection system that checks for trends in mixture of data sources and reports if the end user has anything to be worried/excited about. This project was harder than I first thought. Someone, please donate some cloud credits.

Took part in Global AI Hackathon (June 2017) and made a music player that receives live video feed from camera input and detects the surrounding environment to choose the right song to play from spotify. It then gauges audience engagement and perception and changes songs accordingly. I really need to address the infrastructure to process frames as we had some performance lag. Also, excited to start training the model to see what it does! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kjTLG0EA5E&feature=youtu.be

Suggestions to improve on features will be nice :). I will open source the code, once I clean up. 

Visited NYC, Miami, Orlando, Los Angeles and San Jose in the space of 3 weeks courtesy of graduation ceremony at Columbia University (I am apparently a Master now with my degree), a tour to the United States with my parents and other family reasons.

Random thought of the day –

Data really is the new oil. When do/did the wars begin?
