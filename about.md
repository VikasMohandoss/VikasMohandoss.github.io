I am in graduate school studying Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning.

### More Information

I like to watch football and am an avid follower of Chelsea FC. I like to travel the world as it is fun and broadens my perspective. I enjoy psychology and hope to uncover the secrets of the human mind. I also like to dream and get philosophical about life. I hope to help humans achieve more with or without technology. I do not like boredom and my passion is to not get bored.
