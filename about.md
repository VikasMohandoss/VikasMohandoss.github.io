I am in graduate school studying Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning.

### More Information

I hope to help humans achieve more with or without technology. I enjoy psychology and hope to uncover the secrets of the human mind. I also like to dream and get philosophical about life. I love football and am an avid follower of Chelsea FC. I want to travel the world as it is fun and broadens my perspective.  I do not like boredom and my passion is to not get bored and be productive while I'm at it. In this blog, I write about whatever I feel like getting out of my head and if I feel that the content would be relevant to at least x number of people, where x is 1+number of people I know.
