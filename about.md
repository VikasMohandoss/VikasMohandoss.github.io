I am an Engineer at Microsoft. I studied CS at NITK Surathkal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology,_Karnataka) and then attended Columbia University (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University) to learn Machine Learning to make machines learn. (Say that fast and on repeat).

### More Information

Right now, I hope to help make useful software more inteligent and fast but not intrusive. Eventually, I hope to uncover the secrets of the human mind and enhance its capabilites. I have loved Chelsea FC for 12 years for reasons unkown (Hence, my long term goal). I really really want to win my Fantasy Premier League Mini-League every season. In this blog, you may encounter sudden inactivity and typos and I apologize beforehand. I will push content if I feel that it would be relevant to at least x number of people, where x is > 1
